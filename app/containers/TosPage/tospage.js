      <h4>Eligibility</h4>
      <p>
        The Services are available to and may only be used by individuals or
        companies who can form legally binding contracts under the law
        applicable to their country of residence which may include countries
        like the United States, Canada, North Korea, Syria, Lybia, Sudan, and
        any other jurisdiction in which trading activity of this kind may be

        only be used by individuals who have sufficient experience and knowledge
        in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
        acquiring financial contracts via this Site and have done so without
        relying on any information contained in this Site. By using the Services
        you represent that you are 18 or older, and that you will not permit a

        LiveTrading will terminate the account and remove the information or
        other content. If you open an account on behalf of a company,

        Terms and bind the company, organization, or other entity to these
        Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the company's,
        organization's, or other entity's behalf. Some of the Services may be
        software that is downloaded to your computer, phone, tablet, or other
        device. You agree that we may automatically upgrade those Services, and
        these Terms will apply to such upgrades.
      </p>

      <h4>Cryptocurrencies Third Party Trading</h4>
      <p>
        We are not providing you with any investment, legal, regulatory, tax or
        other form of advice. You are required to rely on your own judgement in
        entering into, or refraining from, providing us with an order or from
        entering into, or refraining from entering into, a transaction. You are
        not entitled to ask us to provide you with investment advice relating to
        Cryptocurrencies, or a transaction or to make any statement of opinion
        to encourage you to enter into a particular transaction. You may wish to
        seek independent legal advice in relation to any transaction you propose
        to enter into under this terms.
      </p>
      <h4>Your Use of Market Data In case of Cryptocurrencies</h4>
      <p>
        “Market Data” are data produced by different exchanges and/or any third
        party. The data may include (without limitation) current market prices
        (“real time” or delayed), opening and closing market prices and ranges,
        high-low market prices, estimated and actual market volumes and the
        size, number and existence of current market bids and offers. Any Market
        Data LiveTrading provides to you, or you access through our website,
        will be provided or made accessible for convenience and information only
        solely to assist you to make your own investment decisions, and does not
        amount to investment advice. THE DATA WILL THEREFORE BE PROVIDED OR MADE
        ACCESSIBLE TO YOU WITHOUT ANY LIABILITY AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY UPON THE
        MARKET DATA IN ANY WAY. In particular, any price quoted in the Market
        Data may differ from the execution price you actually obtain. Market
        Data constitutes valuable confidential information. As such, the data is
        the exclusive property of the exchange or the third party which provided
        such Market Data. Accordingly, you may use it only for your own trading
        purposes under the rules of the relevant exchange and you may not
        redistribute the data in any way.
      </p>
      <h4>System Requirements for the iOS and Android Apps</h4>
      <p>
        In order to use any mobile apps or applications that are part of the
        Services, you are required to have a compatible device, Internet access,
        and the necessary minimum specifications (the "System Requirements").
        You hereby acknowledge that the System Requirements may change from time
        to time, without notice, and that LiveTrading makes no representations
        as to the accuracy of the System Requirements. You may be required to
        obtain software and/or hardware updates or upgrades from time to time,
        as may be necessary for the continued use of the Services. You hereby
        acknowledge and agree that such System Requirements as specified,
        remains your responsibility. We will use reasonable efforts to make the
        mobile apps or applications that are part of the Services available at
        all times. However, you acknowledge that the mobile apps or applications
        that are part of the Services are provided over the Internet and mobile
        networks, and so the quality and availability of the mobile apps or
        applications that are part of the Services may be affected by factors
        outside our reasonable control. You further understand that we cannot
        guarantee that mobile apps or applications are part of the Services. You
        acknowledge that you may log into the Services using certain third party
        sites and services, including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, and
        Google (the "Supported Platform(s)"), and that your ability to do so is
        highly dependent on the availability of such Supported Platforms. If at
        any time any Supported Platforms cease to make their programs available
        to LiveTrading on reasonable terms, LiveTrading may cease to provide
        such features to you without entitling you to refund, credit, or other
        compensation. In order to use the features of the Services related to
        the Supported Platforms, you may be required to register for or log into
        such Supported Platforms on their respective websites or mobile
        applications. By enabling such Supported Platforms within the Services,
        you are allowing LiveTrading to pass your log-in information to these
        Supported Platforms for this purpose. We will use reasonable efforts to
        make the mobile apps or applications that are part of the Services
        available at all times. However, you acknowledge that we cannot
        guarantee that the mobile apps or applications that are part of the
        Services shall always be available, error-free, or fully functional, and
        therefore cannot be held liable for any loss of data, content, etc. that
        results from any such unavailability or non-functionality.
      </p>
      <h4>6. Payment</h4>
      <p>
        While use of most of the Services is free, LiveTrading may offer in-app
        purchases or a paid version of the mobile app or application with
        additional features beyond the free version. You agree that all
        purchases of LiveTrading Services are final and that LiveTrading will
        not refund any transaction once it has been made, including but not
        limited to purchases of Virtual Goods (as hereinafter defined) and
        subscriptions. You are responsible for paying all taxes associated with
        such purchases. If LiveTrading suspends, disables, or terminates your
        account in accordance with Section 19 of this Agreement, you will lose
        access to any Services that you have purchased and LiveTrading will not
        compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you. LiveTrading
        reserves the right to change its fee policy at any time. You acknowledge
        that you are bound by the terms of agreement with your mobile network or
        Internet provider (collectively, the "Mobile Provider"), which will
        continue to apply when using the Services. As a result, you may be
        charged by the Mobile Provider for access to network connection services
        for the duration of the connection while accessing the Services or any
        such third party charges as may arise. You hereby acknowledge that
        LiveTrading is not responsible for such charges or services. If you are
        not the authorized party to make payment for any Mobile Provider charges
        incurred to access the Services, you hereby warrant and represent that
        you have all necessary authority from such authorized party to use the
        Services.
      </p>

        reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account at any time for
        any or no reason. In creating your account, we ask that you provide
        complete and accurate information. You may not create or use an account
        for anyone other than yourself, provide an email address other than your

        use the same account information in connection with third party services
        or applications or permit third party services or applications to share
        information about you with LiveTrading. For accessing some Services, you
        may be required to provide personal information such as identification
        or contact details as part of the registration process. You agree that
        any information you submit to LiveTrading is accurate and up to date.
        You agree to use these Services only for purposes as laid out by the (a)
        Terms and (b) any applicable law. You agree that you are solely

      <p>
        We will post details of your account activity on the website. Updated

        </span>{' '}

        will be deemed delivery to you of any relevant information (such as
        confirmations and account statements). We may at our sole discretion
        withdraw or amend any Account Information at any time. Unless otherwise
        agreed by us you agree that we are under no obligation to provide
        confirmations in hard copy or by email rather than through the website.
        The Account Information (save if manifestly incorrect) will be
        conclusive evidence of your transactions, open positions, Margin and
        cash balances and will be binding on you if not objected to [on the day

        electronic mail) no later than close of business on the Business Day
        following the day on which the Account Information is posted.{' '}
      </p>
      <h4>9. Subscriptions</h4>
      <p>
        Some portions of the Services may be accessed only upon paying a
        subscription fee for access (each, a "Subscription"). Each Subscription
        you purchase may automatically renew on a monthly or annual basis unless
        you cancel the Subscription prior to renewal. By purchasing a
        Subscription, you hereby authorize LiveTrading to charge your iTunes
        account, Google Play Store account, or credit or debit card on a monthly
        or annual basis for the Subscription fee amount (the "Subscription
        Fee"). You agree to ensure that all credit card, debit card, and other
        payment information supplied by you is accurate and correct and kept
        updated with LiveTrading, Apple, Google, or any third-party payment or
        service facility used by LiveTrading at all times and that you are fully
        authorized to use such credit card, debit card, and other payment
        information (or account with any third party payment or service facility
        used by LiveTrading) for purposes of paying for your Subscription Fee.
        LiveTrading reserves the right to discontinue or modify any Subscription
        Fee payment option. The Subscription Fee is non-refundable, and you are
        responsible for all recurring charges made prior to the effective date
        of cancellation of the Subscription. You acknowledge that we may or may
        not remind you of automatic Subscription renewals, and that it is
        therefore your responsibility to timely cancel any Subscription you do
        not want to renew. Cancellation of any Subscription will be effective at
        the end of the current Subscription term. You understand that once
        payment is made for your Subscription Fee, you will not seek to cancel,
        charge back, or otherwise seek a refund on any basis that is fraudulent,
        misleading, or untrue.
      </p>
      <h4>10. LiveTrading Partner Program</h4>
      <p>
        LiveTrading may offer certain users the opportunity to earn revenue from
        broadcasting via the Services (the "LiveTrading Partner Program"),
        including but not limited to based on the amount of certain Virtual
        Items received by such LiveTrading Partner Program participant or the
        revenues received by LiveTrading from users paying for a Subscription to
        access such LiveTrading Partner Program participant's Content.
        LiveTrading may create any application process or requirements it
        determines to be appropriate in choosing LiveTrading Partner Program
        participants, and may accept or reject any application or request to

        you agree to the terms of this Section 10. By accepting an offer to

        (b) that all information provided by you to LiveTrading is accurate and
        up-to-date, including but not limited to any and all forms, documents,
        agreements, or certifications LiveTrading may request (including any IRS
        Form W-9); <br />
        (c) your participation in the LiveTrading Partner Program and your

        we may deduct or withhold any taxes from any payments made to you as
        required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation, and payment to you

        payment and settlement to you of such payment under these Terms.

        discretion, to terminate your participation in the LiveTrading Partner
        Program and/or LiveTrading account if you engage in, or permit any other

        LiveTrading may deduct the amount of any chargeback, fraudulent charge,
        or other amount related to Fraudulent Actions from future payments due
        to you, and may temporarily withhold or delay payments to any
        LiveTrading Partner Program participant who it determines is at high
        risk for Fraudulent Actions or illegal activity, in its sole discretion.
        You acknowledge and agree that LiveTrading may modify, suspend, or
        terminate the LiveTrading Partner Program terms or functionality, or
        your participation in the LiveTrading Partner Program at any time, in
        its sole discretion, including but not limited to based on the quality
        of your Content, your failure to provide Content on a consistent basis,
        or as a result of your breach of these Terms. You acknowledge and agree
        that subscribers to your Content belong to LiveTrading. As between you
        and us, all pricing, terms, rules, policies and procedures concerning
        the purchase and use of Virtual Items, Subscriptions, and any other
        LiveTrading products and services will apply to those subscribers, and
        we may change them at any time. If another user contacts you regarding
        the Services, you agree to instruct such user to contact LiveTrading to
        address any customer service matters, and will not handle or address any
        such issues in any other manner.

        All promotions offering benefits to our users and potential users that
        we offer or may offer in the future are subject to specific promotional
        terms and conditions pursuant to which such benefits must be used. We
        reserve the right to amend, retract and/or cancel any and all Promotions
        at any time. Certain promotions may not be available in certain
        countries, as shall be determined by us at our sole discretion and shall

        At all times, we reserve the right to deny, withhold or withdraw any

        that a user (whether alone or with others) has manipulated or abused (or
        attempted to do so)a promotion and/or otherwise acted in bad faith
        towards us (including without limitation, by withdrawing the initial
        deposit(s), arbitrage trading, risk reduced profiting, hedging or
        counter-hedging related positions etc.), then, we reserve the right, at
        our sole discretion, to take the following actions with respect to any
        such user and/or to any person we consider is acting in concert with
        such user: <br />
        (i) temporarily or permanently, block, suspend or terminate the Services
        or any portion thereof and close the Account, and/or <br />
        (ii) remove and/or deduct any benefit which might have been granted to
        such users (taking into account any loss sustained which will be fully
        recognized); and/or <br />
        (iii) remove and/or deduct any profits gained by such users as a result
        of such manipulation or abuse, including by closing any open positions
        the applicable Account(s), and/or <br />
        (iii) deny, withhold or withdraw from that user such promotion and any

      <h3>RISKS WARNINGS, DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY </h3>
      <h4>Risk Warnings and Disclaimers</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Trading risks - Since Cryptocurrencies markets are decentralized and
            non-regulated. Third Party Cryptocurrencies Trading Services are
            unregulated services which are not governed by any specific European
            regulatory framework (including MIFID). This means that there is no
            central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value
            of Cryptocurrencies in a crisis or issue more currency. Therefore,
            when using Third Party Cryptocurrencies Trading Services, you will
            not benefit from the protections available to clients receiving
            regulated investment services such as the access to the Investor
            Compensation Fund for Customers of Cypriot Investment Firms and the
            Financial Ombudsman Service for dispute resolution. You will
            continue to benefit from the rules relating to best execution and
            client money and safekeeping of client assets. LiveTrading will not
            be responsible in the event of losses caused by those third parties.{' '}
            <br />
            <span className="knoledg">
              YOU HEREBY FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CRYPTOCURRENCIES MARKETS
              ARE DETERMINED BY DEMAND AND SUPPLY ONLY
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            The Cryptocurrencies market is a dynamic arena and their respective
            prices are often highly unpredictable and volatile. The prices of
            Cryptocurrency is usually not transparent and highly speculative and
            susceptible to market manipulation. In the worst case scenario the
            product could be rendered worthless.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is important to make a distinction between indicative prices
            which are displayed on charts and dealable prices which are
            displayed on our livestreaming trading platform. Indicative quotes
            only give an indication of where the market is. Because the
            Cryptocurrencies markets are decentralized, meaning it lacks a
            single central exchange where all transactions are conducted, each
            market maker may quote slightly different prices. Therefore, any
            prices displayed on any chart made available by us or by a third
            party will only reflect "indicative" prices and not necessarily
            actual "dealing" prices where trades can be executed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cryptocurrency trading is prone to being misused for illegal
            activities due to the anonymity of transactions and investors would
            be adversely affected if law enforcement agencies investigate any
            alleged illicit activities.
          </li>
          <br />
          <span className="knoledg">
            ACCORDINGLY, CRYPTOCURRENCIES SHOULD BE SEEN LIKE AS AN EXTREMELY
            HIGH RISK ASSET AND YOU SHOULD NEVER INVEST FUNDS THAT YOU CANNOT
            AFFORD TO LOSE.
          </span>
          <li>
            Given the foregoing, Cryptocurrencies are not appropriate for all
            investors. You should not deal in these products unless you have the
            necessary knowledge and expertise, you understand these products’
            characteristics and your exposure to risk. You should also be
            satisfied that the product is suitable for you in light of your
            circumstances and financial position. In addition, use of our Third
            Party Services can never be considered a safe investment rather only
            an investment with a high risk of loss inherently associated with
            it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The risk of loss in trading Cryptocurrencies can be substantial. You
            should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is
            suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial
            resources. You should be aware that You may sustain a total loss of
            the funds
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Internet and computers transmission risks</h4>
      <p>
        There are risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based trading
        system including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software,
        and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction,
        and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
        information and/or assets (including your Cryptocurrencies) stored on
        your behalf.
      </p>
      <h4>Blockchain Risks.</h4>
      <p>
        Since blockchain is an independent public peer-to peer network and is
        not controlled in any way or manner by the LiveTrading, LiveTrading
        shall not be responsible for any failure and/or mistake and/or error
        and/or breach which shall occur in blockchain or in any other networks
        in which the Cryptocurrencies are being issued and/or traded. You will
        be bound and subject to any change and/or amendments in the blockchain
        system and subject to any applicable law which may apply to the
        blockchain. We make no representation or warranty of any kind, express
        or implied, statutory or otherwise, regarding the Blockchain
        functionality nor for any breach of security in the Blockchain.
      </p>
      <h4>Operation of Cryptocurrency Protocols.</h4>
      <p>
        LiveTrading does not own or control the underlying software protocols
        which govern the operation of Cryptocurrencies available for trading on
        our platform. In general, the underlying protocols are open source and
        anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. LiveTrading is not
        responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and LiveTrading
        makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability.
        The underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating
        rules (“Forks”), and such Forks may materially affect the value,
        function, and/or even the name of the Cryptocurrency LiveTrading holds
        for your benefit. In the event of a Fork, LiveTrading may temporarily
        suspend LiveTrading operations (with or without advance notice to you)
        and that LiveTrading may <br />
        (a) configure or reconfigure its systems or
        <br />
        (b) decide not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked protocol
        entirely. LiveTrading may, but is not obligated to do so, adjust your
        account in respect of a Fork depending on the circumstances of each
        event attributable to any specific Cryptocurrency held by You.
      </p>
      <h4>Third Parties’ Risks</h4>
      <p>
        We may elect to execute any order and/or hold any fiat money and
        Cryptocurrencies via Third Parties. Such Third Parties are not banks
        that hold their fiat money/virtual currency as a deposit.If any such
        Third Party loses any money, fails or goes out of business, there is no
        specific legal protection that covers you for losses arising from any
        funds you may have held with such Third Party, even when such party is
        registered with a national authority. Depending on the structure and
        security of the digital wallet, some may be vulnerable to hacks,
        resulting in the theft of virtual currency or loss of customer assets.
        LiveTrading will not be responsible in the event of losses caused by
        those Third Parties.
      </p>

        interruptions caused by any computer viruses, spyware, scareware, Trojan
        horses, worms or other malware that may affect your computer or other
        equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack. We advise the
        regular use of a reputable and readily available virus screening and
        prevention software. You should also be aware that SMS and email
        services are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use
        care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from LiveTrading.
